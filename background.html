	<h1> Background and Significance of the Project </h1>
	<img src="justice.jpg" />	
	<p>			
	Our proposed project - Marahuyo sa Kalinaw, a bookmark for a cause project, aims to solve the lack of awareness of sexual exploitation. Conversations around sexual exploitation have been considered taboo for a long time; this stigma around talks on sexual exploitation lessens the opportunities for sexual exploitation to be talked about and solved and enables the continuous discrimination against sexually exploited individuals. Our proposed subject would help us combat the lack of awareness of sexual exploitation.<br>

    Our proposed solution, bookmark for a cause, can help the institution achieve its goals and mission to help victims of sexual exploitation to regain their rights and dignity. This proposed solution will be effective because we would be able to provide Talikala with the resources they need and, at the same time, help them gather a good community to support and help more victims of sexual exploitation. Additionally, this project can be taught to and adapted by the beneficiaries of our partner institution, allowing them to sustain themselves after we bid them farewell.<br>

    Our project proposal is significant to our partner institution because it will become a medium of awareness about Talikala and sexual exploitation. It will bring light to prostitution and Talikala's mission; thus, it will help remove misconceptions and stigma around prostitution and prostitutes, enabling an environment where Talikala's beneficiaries can recover well and reintegrate into society without discrimination.<br>

    Our project is of value for Ateneans as it is a way for them to immerse themselves in making an effort to make our community and society a better place. This bookmark-for-a-cause project not only provides a physical material needed and wanted by the public, but it also provides knowledge that would open the minds of the masses, thus creating a society that will warmly welcome back the last least and lost.<br>

    Our project is essential to the public since they need to be aware of what is happening with the women and children involved in sex work around us. The public's knowledge about the truths of prostitution and the experiences of prostitutes can entice them to contribute to protecting and guiding the mentioned individuals. The public must be conscious of what is happening in the sex industry since everyone must always defend the rights of current and former sex workers.<br>

    Our team seeks to help the institution fix this problem. We are pleased to implement this project to help women and children, victims of sexual exploitation, regain their rights, and live daily - free of discrimination.

	<h1>Identifying the Problem and Proposed Intervention </h1>
	<img src="tlk.jpg" />	
	<p>
	The problem is the lack of awareness of sexual exploitation and Talikala INC. The lack of attention and understanding of sexual exploitation has long existed; it adds to the stigma and discrimination around sex workers, offering them little chance of working, studying, and reintegrating into society properly. This problem occurs almost everywhere, but Talikala focuses more on the Philippines, specifically Davao City. <br>
